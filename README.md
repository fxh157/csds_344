# CSDS 444 Group 7 Coding Project

To test our code run the following command.
```python
python encryption_gui.py
```
Vigenere Cipher requires key of only alphabetical characters.
DES requires hex key.
RSA and md5-Checksum do not require a key, only the plain text.

Note to test md5 try running somethings like "message digest" or "message digests" to see how much the result changes even with changing one letter.
